# User Guide: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account. Instead of just a password, you will need a 6-digit code from your phone to log in.

## 1. How to Enable 2FA

1.  **Log In**: Sign in to your account with your email and password.
2.  **Go to Profile**: Click on your name/avatar in the top right corner and select **Profile**.
3.  **Find 2FA Section**: Scroll down to the **Two Factor Authentication** section.
4.  **Enable**: Click the **Enable** button.
5.  **Confirm Password**: For security, you will be asked to enter your password again.
6.  **Scan QR Code**:
    *   Open an authenticator app on your phone (e.g., **Google Authenticator**, **Authy**, or **Microsoft Authenticator**).
    *   Select "Add Account" or the "+" icon.
    *   Choose "Scan QR Code" and point your camera at the QR code displayed on your screen.
7.  **Verify**: Enter the 6-digit code shown in your app into the verification box on the website to confirm it is linked correctly.

## 2. Recovery Codes (Very Important!)

Once 2FA is enabled, the website will show you a list of **Recovery Codes**.

*   **What are they?**: These are emergency codes you can use if you lose your phone or delete the authenticator app.
*   **What should you do?**: Copy these codes and store them in a safe place (like a password manager, a physical notebook, or an encrypted file). 
*   **Usage**: Each recovery code can be used **only once**.

## 3. How to Log In with 2FA

1.  Enter your **Email** and **Password** as usual.
2.  The next screen will ask for your **Authentication Code**.
3.  Open your authenticator app on your phone.
4.  Type the 6-digit code currently shown for this website.
5.  Click **Log In**.

## 4. Using Recovery Codes to Log In

If you don't have your phone:
1.  On the 2FA screen, click **"Use a recovery code"**.
2.  Enter one of the 8-10 character recovery codes you saved earlier.
3.  Click **Log In**.

## 5. Troubleshooting & Safety Tips

*   **Time Sync**: If your 6-digit code is being rejected, ensure your phone's time is set to **Automatic**. Authenticator codes are time-based and will fail if your phone's clock is off by even a minute.
*   **Don't Share**: Never share your 2FA codes or recovery codes with anyone, including support staff.
*   **Backup**: If you get a new phone, remember to transfer your authenticator accounts or use your recovery codes to disable and re-enable 2FA on the new device.
